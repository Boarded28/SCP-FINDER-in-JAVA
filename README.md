A simple HTML scraper for SCP-Wiki built using [jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) — part of my learning journey to understand web scraping and data parsing in Java.

## 🧪 What This Is
Just a small experimental project I made while learning how to use jsoup. It scrapes SCP-Wiki pages to extract readable content, helping me get hands-on with HTML parsing, HTTP requests, and DOM traversal.

Totally for educational purposes. Nothing fancy, just me tinkering and learning!
